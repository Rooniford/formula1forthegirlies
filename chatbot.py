    ("what makes the mclaren car so good?", "part of the reason the mclaren car is performing so well is because of their rear tyre managment. no one quite knows how (yet), but their rear tyres just dont overheat as fast as everyone elses"),
    ("is the mclaren car legal?", "while redbull has accused mclaren of cheating several times already in 2025, the mclaren car is currently up to code!"),
    ("why was mclaren accused of cheating?", "redbull thought that mclaren was possibly still using mini-DRS in the 2025 season, which would be against FIA regulations"),
    ("is a car spike legal?", "not anymore. however, in 2024, when mclaren implimented it for the first time, it was within regulations"),
